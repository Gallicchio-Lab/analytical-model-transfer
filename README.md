# Analytical Model of Alchemical Transfer
Simulation input files, analytical model of coupling and of transfer with corresponding data for the paper "Potential Distribution Theory of Alchemical Transfer" by Solmaz Azimi and Emilio Gallicchio. Pre-print can be accessed at https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14713. 

The analytical model for 3-mode parameterization is initiated with `3m_opt.py`. Mathematica notebooks for analysis of parameters are included for two processes: coupling and transfer. 

- `simulation-input`: input files of each calculation (hydration, coupling, and transfer) for each system based on AToM-OpenMM and OpenMM's ATMForce version 8.1.1
-  `data`: input data for the analytical model of each calculation (hydration, coupling, and transfer) for each system
-  `work`: sorted parameterization of coupling and hydration calculations
-  `scripts`: script to produce latex tables of results
